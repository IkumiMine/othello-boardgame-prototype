# Othello

## Basic rule
Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. Each player plays with black or white 32 discs. If you sandwich the opponent’s colours’ discs with your discs, you can flip all opponent’s discs between your discs. That way you can increase your colour of the discs. At the end of the game, a person who has a majority of the colour discs wins the game.
